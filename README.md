# Practical Machine Learning
 
   In  this course  I’ve  studied  a  few  supervised (KNN,  SVM,  ANN)  and  unsupervised (Kmeans,  Hierarchical  clus-tering Agglomerative, DbScan) methods for machine learning.
   - I’ve completed two projects, one with two supervised methods and one with two unsupervised methods on the same dataset I worked for my bachelor thesis.
   - In other words, I’ve continued the research on ”Brain tumor classification” using SVM on extracted features (GLCMand GLRLM) and compared to feed forward neural networks for supervised methods.
   - I’ ve also compared compared Kmeans and Hierarchical clustering Agglomerative for unsupervised methods.
   - The results are in 'Comparing_supervised_and_unsupervised_methods.pdf' pdf file.
